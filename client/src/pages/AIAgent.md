# AI Agent Page Enhancements

This document explains the recent enhancements to the Algo360FX AI Agent page and provides troubleshooting steps if the changes aren't showing up correctly.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Expanded AI Model Support
- Added support for multiple AI model providers:
  - OpenAI models: GPT-4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 Turbo
  - Anthropic models: Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3 Sonnet
  - Google: Gemini Pro
  - Mistral: Mistral Large
  - Meta: Llama 3 (coming soon)

### 2. Improved User Interface
- Organized model selection into provider categories
- Enhanced model information dialog with detailed capabilities
- Improved the preset prompts section with categorized trading prompts
- Added System Prompt templates for different trading specialties

### 3. Trading-Specific Features
- Added new trading-focused preset prompts organized by category:
  - Market Analysis
  - Trading Strategies
  - Technical Analysis & Education
  - Programming & Automation

## Troubleshooting Implementation Issues

If the AI Agent page enhancements aren't appearing correctly, try these steps:

### 1. Run the Rebuild Script
Execute the provided PowerShell script to perform a clean rebuild:
```powershell
.\rebuild-ai-agent.ps1
```

### 2. Hard Refresh the Browser
Force a complete page reload:
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R
- Mac: Cmd+Shift+R

### 3. Check Browser Console for Errors
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) to look for JavaScript errors that might prevent rendering.

### 4. Verify OpenAI API Keys
Make sure valid API keys are configured for each service:
- OpenAI API key for GPT models
- Anthropic API key for Claude models
- Google API key for Gemini
- Mistral API key for Mistral models

### 5. Note on Service Integration
Currently, the AI service implementation provides mock interfaces for non-OpenAI models. In a production environment, you would need to:
1. Register for each provider's API
2. Configure appropriate API keys
3. Update the rate limit and token usage tracking

## What to Expect

When working correctly, the AI Agent page should:
1. Display all AI models in categorized sections
2. Allow model selection that persists between sessions
3. Show organized preset prompts by category
4. Provide advanced system prompt templates when Advanced Mode is enabled

## Important Notes

- This implementation focuses on frontend interface without complete backend integration
- The mockup assumes OpenAI API for all providers as a demonstration
- In production, you'll need to implement proper API integrations with each provider
