# Position Sizing Strategies

Position sizing is a critical aspect of risk management that determines how much capital to allocate to each trade.

## Position Sizing Methods

### 1. Fixed Position Size
```typescript
interface FixedSizeParams {
  positionSize: number;
  maxPositions: number;
}
```

Fixed position sizing involves using the same position size for every trade. While simple, it may not be optimal for all market conditions.

### 2. Percentage of Capital
```typescript
interface PercentageParams {
  riskPercentage: number;
  maxRiskPerTrade: number;
}
```

This method risks a fixed percentage of your trading capital on each trade, allowing position sizes to scale with your account balance.

### 3. Position Size Calculator
